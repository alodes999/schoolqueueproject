#Student Queue project.

The goal of the project is to enable students to log in, and place themselves in a queue to receive help from the teacher.  They should also be able to delete their requests in the queue.

The teacher should be able to log in, and view the list of students awaiting help, and remove students after they receive help, or upon request of the student.  They should be able to toggle whether or not students can make multiple requests in the queue as well.

Each class should have it's own queue list, and the teacher should be able to sort lists by class.
